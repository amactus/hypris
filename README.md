Web-based stream overlays

---

Originally designed by [Jexel](https://github.com/JexeI)  
Rebuilt for use on [Stratus](https://github.com/StratusNetwork) by [amactus](https://github.com/amactus)

Provides a web-based GUI board for on-the-fly livestream ajustments by a costreamer or other operator, which is then directly pulled onto the stream through OBS window capturing.
